//how I envision using SimpactII:

s = Simpact();
s.population = 1000; //'regular' agents
s.addAgents('MSM',1000);
s.addAgents('SugarDaddys',10);
s.simRunTime = 5; //5 years

s.run() //also s.run(10) -- checkpoints every 10 time steps

s.export('All'); //alternatively just 'relations' or 'population'

BackBurner to consider:
-how will graphing work?
-Network object does not keep track of it's history, for "event counting" we'll have to think of something
